        This is a portfolio site that was built by Nick Sturch-Flint and Scott Alton with the help of 
        our WEBD6201 professor Tom Tsiliopoulos. With his help we have created a site that shows you 
        some of our favourite projects we've built, what services we offer, and a little more about ourselves.

        Our goal is to help you visualize and realize your application ambitions by bringing our expertise
        in building full stack apps, and our comfortability working with clients again and again. By implementing
        a front end of ejs, node.js and just run of the mill HTML and CSS, and combining it with express, passport
        and MongoDB Atlas we can build your dream application is record time!
