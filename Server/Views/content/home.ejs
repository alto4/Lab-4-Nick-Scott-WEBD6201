    This is a portfolio site that was built by Nick Sturch-Flint and Scott Alton with the help of 
    our WEBD6201 professor Tom Tsiliopoulos. With his help we have created a site that shows you 
    some of our favourite projects we've built, what services we offer, and a little more about ourselves.
